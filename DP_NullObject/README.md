# Null Object Pattern Definition

The Null Object Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides an object as a substitute for null. It aims to handle null references transparently by providing a default behavior when an object reference is expected to be null.

In essence, instead of returning null when an object is not available or cannot be found, the Null Object Pattern returns an object that implements the same interface as the expected object but provides a default or "do nothing" behavior. This allows clients to treat the absence of an object in a uniform way without the need for explicit null checks.
